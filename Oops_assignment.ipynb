        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class, with its own unique values for the properties defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class.\n",
        "Encapsulation also includes restricting access to certain details of an object to protect it from unintended interference. This is often achieved using access modifiers like public, private, and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "It allows users to interact with an object at a higher level, without needing to understand the internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes, making it easier to build complex systems based on simpler ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be used in different ways depending on the context.\n",
        "The two main types of polymorphism are method overriding (changing the implementation of a method in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
        "Together, these concepts help structure code in a modular, reusable, and maintainable way.\n",
